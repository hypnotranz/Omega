## Epilogue: The Structure of Understanding
We began this journey with a simple observation: language models can understand meaning. We end with a new kind of programming—one where computation and comprehension intertwine.

The lessons of SICP—abstraction, composition, laziness, nondeterminism, metalinguistic power—all apply, but transformed. Where Abelson and Sussman built evaluators for algorithms, we build evaluators for inference. Where they abstracted over procedures, we abstract over understanding.

The programs in this book are not just instructions for computation. They are invocations of meaning. They ask questions that no algorithm could answer, and they compose those answers into new knowledge.

This is programming for the age of AI: precise where precision matters, open to understanding where understanding matters, and always, always compositional.

The journey continues. Every new capability of language models becomes a new primitive for inference programming. Every insight into evaluation becomes a way to structure semantic computation.

Welcome to the structure and interpretation of inference programs.
